# 🔧 Render Database Authentication Fix

## Problem
The Render service is showing password authentication errors despite successful password rotation because the `DATABASE_URL` contains special characters that need URL encoding.

## Root Cause
The database password contains special characters (like `=`) that must be URL-encoded when used in a connection string.

## Solution

### Step 1: Update Render Environment Variables

Go to your Render service dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cbng55ha6gds3kmf2890

**Replace your current `DATABASE_URL` with the properly URL-encoded version:**
```
postgresql://possue2_db_v5_user:[URL_ENCODED_PASSWORD]@dpg-d1can6re5dus73fcd83g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com:5432/possue2_db_v5?sslmode=require
```

**Note:** Replace `[URL_ENCODED_PASSWORD]` with your actual password that has special characters URL-encoded (e.g., `=` becomes `%3D`, `/` becomes `%2F`).

**Key changes:**
- Password `=` is now encoded as `%3D`
- Added `:5432` port specification
- Added `?sslmode=require` for SSL

### Step 2: Remove Conflicting Variables (Optional but Recommended)

To avoid conflicts, remove these individual database environment variables from Render:
- `DATABASE_HOST`
- `DATABASE_PORT` 
- `DATABASE_NAME`
- `DATABASE_USERNAME`
- `DATABASE_PASSWORD`

Keep only the `DATABASE_URL` - Strapi will use it automatically.

### Step 3: Save and Redeploy

1. Click "Save Changes" in Render
2. This will trigger an automatic redeploy
3. Monitor the deployment logs for success

## Verification

After the redeploy, you should see:
- ✅ No more password authentication errors in logs
- ✅ API endpoints responding normally
- ✅ Database queries working properly

## Technical Details

The updated database configuration now:
1. **Prioritizes DATABASE_URL** when available
2. **Handles SSL properly** with `rejectUnauthorized: false`
3. **Uses proper connection string format** instead of object format
4. **Includes connection pooling** for performance

## Backup Individual Variables

If you prefer to keep individual environment variables as backup, ensure they match:

```
DATABASE_HOST=dpg-d1can6re5dus73fcd83g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=possue2_db_v5
DATABASE_USERNAME=possue2_db_v5_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=[YOUR_ACTUAL_PASSWORD]
```

**Note:** The individual `DATABASE_PASSWORD` does NOT need URL encoding - only the `DATABASE_URL` does.

## Testing Locally

If you want to test locally with the same configuration:

```bash
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://possue2_db_v5_user:[URL_ENCODED_PASSWORD]@dpg-d1can6re5dus73fcd83g-a.oregon-postgres.render.com:5432/possue2_db_v5?sslmode=require"
npm run develop
```

This fix should completely resolve the password authentication errors in your Render deployment.
