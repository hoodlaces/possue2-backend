# üóÉÔ∏è DATABASE CHANGE APPROVAL PROCESS

## üö® CRITICAL: USER DATA PROTECTION PROTOCOL

**ALL database changes that could affect user data MUST follow this approval process.**

---

## üìã OVERVIEW

### What Requires Approval:
- ‚úÖ **Schema changes** (adding/removing/modifying columns)
- ‚úÖ **Index changes** (adding/removing indexes)
- ‚úÖ **Data migration scripts** (bulk data updates)
- ‚úÖ **Table structure changes** (constraints, relationships)
- ‚úÖ **User table modifications** (ANY change to up_users table)

### What Does NOT Require Approval:
- ‚ùå **Content changes** (essays, answers, subjects)
- ‚ùå **Configuration changes** (environment variables)
- ‚ùå **Code-only deployments** (no database impact)

---

## üîç CHANGE CLASSIFICATION

### üü¢ LOW RISK Changes
- Adding optional columns
- Adding non-unique indexes
- Adding new tables (not related to users)

### üü° MEDIUM RISK Changes  
- Modifying existing columns (type changes)
- Adding constraints to existing tables
- Data migration scripts
- Adding indexes that may lock tables

### üî¥ HIGH RISK Changes
- Removing columns or tables
- Changing user table structure
- Any change affecting authentication
- Bulk data updates to user records
- Changes to primary keys or relationships

## üìù APPROVAL WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Pre-Approval Documentation

Create a change request document with:

```markdown

## Change Description
[Detailed description of what needs to be changed]

## Business Justification
[Why this change is needed]

## Tables Affected
- [ ] up_users (USER DATA - CRITICAL)
- [ ] [Other tables...]

## Impact Assessment
- **User Data**: [Will user data be affected? How?]
- **Downtime**: [Expected downtime if any]

```

### Step 2: Review and Approval

#### For LOW RISK Changes:
- [ ] **Self-review** of change request
- [ ] **Test on staging** environment
- [ ] **Create backup plan**
- [ ] **Proceed with deployment**

#### For MEDIUM RISK Changes:
- [ ] **Complete change request** documentation
- [ ] **Peer review** by another developer
- [ ] **Test thoroughly** on staging
- [ ] **Prepare rollback scripts**
- [ ] **Schedule during maintenance window**

#### For HIGH RISK Changes:
- [ ] **Complete detailed change request**
- [ ] **Technical review** by senior developer/architect
- [ ] **Business approval** from project owner
- [ ] **Extensive testing** on staging environment
- [ ] **Multiple backup strategies**
- [ ] **Scheduled maintenance window**
- [ ] **Rollback procedures tested**
- [ ] **Monitoring plan** for post-deployment

---

## üõ°Ô∏è SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### For ALL Database Changes:

#### Pre-Change Requirements:
- [ ] **Backup verification script** must pass
- [ ] **Migration scripts** created and tested
- [ ] **Rollback scripts** prepared and tested
- [ ] **Staging environment** testing completed
- [ ] **User data integrity** verification plan ready

#### During Change:
- [ ] **Monitor actively** during deployment
- [ ] **Stop immediately** if issues detected
- [ ] **Document** any unexpected behavior
- [ ] **Verify each step** before proceeding

#### Post-Change Requirements:
- [ ] **Run verification scripts** to confirm success
- [ ] **Monitor system** for 24 hours minimum
- [ ] **Test user functionality** thoroughly
- [ ] **Document results** and any issues

---

## üìä SPECIFIC PROTECTION FOR USER DATA

### up_users Table Changes

**CRITICAL**: Any change to the `up_users` table requires maximum protection:

#### Pre-Change Checklist:
- [ ] **User count documented**: Current user count recorded
- [ ] **Sample data exported**: Representative user records saved
- [ ] **All user emails verified**: Ensure no duplicate/invalid emails
- [ ] **Authentication tested**: Current login process working
- [ ] **Backup created**: Full database backup completed
- [ ] **Rollback tested**: Restore procedure verified

#### Migration Requirements:
- [ ] **Non-destructive migrations only**: Never DROP columns with data
- [ ] **Add columns with defaults**: New columns must have safe defaults
- [ ] **Preserve all existing data**: Zero data loss tolerance
- [ ] **Maintain relationships**: Foreign keys must remain valid
- [ ] **Test with real data**: Use production-like dataset for testing

#### Post-Change Verification:
- [ ] **User count unchanged**: Same number of users before/after
- [ ] **Authentication works**: Users can still log in
- [ ] **No data corruption**: Sample data matches pre-change
- [ ] **New features work**: Added functionality operates correctly
- [ ] **Performance maintained**: No significant slowdown

## üîß MIGRATION SCRIPT STANDARDS

### Required Structure:
```sql
-- MIGRATION: [Description]
-- DATE: [Date]
-- RISK LEVEL: [Low/Medium/High]
-- AUTHOR: [Name]

-- Start transaction for atomicity
BEGIN;

-- Log migration start
INSERT INTO migration_log (migration_name, started_at, status) 
VALUES ('[migration_name]', NOW(), 'STARTED');

-- Pre-change verification
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Verify expected state
    -- Add safety checks here
END $$;

-- Actual changes (with safety checks)
-- [Your migration code here]

-- Post-change verification
DO $$
BEGIN
    -- Verify migration success
    -- Add validation checks here
END $$;

-- Log migration completion
UPDATE migration_log 
SET completed_at = NOW(), status = 'COMPLETED' 
WHERE migration_name = '[migration_name]';

-- Final safety verification
-- [Add final checks here]

COMMIT;
```

### Required Rollback Script:
```sql
-- ROLLBACK: [Description]
-- FOR MIGRATION: [Original migration name]

BEGIN;

-- Document rollback start
INSERT INTO migration_log (migration_name, started_at, status) 
VALUES ('[migration_name]_ROLLBACK', NOW(), 'STARTED');

-- Rollback changes
-- [Undo migration steps]

-- Verify rollback success
-- [Add verification]

-- Log rollback completion
UPDATE migration_log 
SET completed_at = NOW(), status = 'COMPLETED' 
WHERE migration_name = '[migration_name]_ROLLBACK';

COMMIT;
```

## üö® VIOLATION REPORTING

### If Process is Bypassed:
1. **Document the incident** immediately
2. **Assess data integrity** impact
3. **Implement additional safeguards** if needed
4. **Review process** for gaps
5. **Retrain team** on importance of procedures

### Zero Tolerance Policy:
- **User data loss** due to unapproved changes
- **Skipping backup procedures** before high-risk changes
- **Deploying untested migrations** to production

**üõ°Ô∏è REMEMBER: User data protection is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, ask for approval.**
