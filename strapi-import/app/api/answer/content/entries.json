    "content": "<p style=\"margin-left:0px;\">The call of the question give us the \"Answer to California Law\" so we know it's Wills or CP. Going back to the opening paragraph we immediately spot \"Trusts.\"</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br>Churches Arguments Supporting It's Claim To the Trust.<br><strong>Creation of Trust</strong><br>The first paragraph rattles off a lot of informational facts leading us to believe that a Creation of Trust is to be discussed. Our neumonic for this is <strong>SIP-D-ATV</strong><span style=\"color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, Roboto, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Noto Sans&quot;, sans-serif, &quot;Apple Color Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Symbol&quot;, &quot;Noto Color Emoji&quot;;\"><strong>🏍️</strong></span>, so in this case we have: Wilma as Settlor, Intent to create a trust, the Property of 1 million, Delivery as 1 million was put into the trust, Ascertainable Bennys (in this case the Church, a charitable organization), Trustee (if no trustee is named a court will appoint one), and a Valid Purpose. In order for a trust to qualify as charitable, the trust needs to benefit the public and charitable purposes furthering health, religion, and / or education. On these facts, Wilma created a valid trust with Church as a beneficiary.<br><br><br><strong>Termination of Trust</strong><br>Charitable trusts must be perpetual and can terminate in one of three ways: (1) expiration of trust term (2) trust revoked by Settlor, Benny, or Trustee (in CA Trustee can revoke only if principal is not &gt; 40k) or (3) trust purpose fulfilled. Here, Wilma created a charitable trust without mentioning any (1) expiration and there is (2) no facts that state Wilma (Settlor) revoked the trust in life or death. So Sis, with the only remaining way to terminate the trust being that the purpose would be fulfilled, won't be able to since fulfillment has not been reached.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br>Sis and Dora's Arguments to their Respective Claims<br><strong>Challenging the Validity of the Will</strong><br>A valid will requires (1) testator with capacity (2) intent and (3) valid formalities.<br>Here, \"Sis paid attention to Wilma\" and the fact that Wilma \"reluctantly\" left her entire estate doesn't isn't enough to show undue influence. Secondly, Wilma was the one who created the will satisfying the requirement of testamentary intent. The facts show Wilma had capacity so that isn't at issue. Finally, a gift to a sister is not an unnatural bequest, indicated by Wilmas later note that Wilma was pleased with the bequest.<br>Conclusion is that Sid did not exercise an undue influence over a valid will and that not including the Church trust, Sis should be entitled to the entire estate.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br><br><strong>Dora (the explorer)'s Challenge To Wilma's will.</strong><br>When challenging a will, the burden of proving Undue Influence (SOUP) rests on the person trying to contest the will. There are three rules that apply in this case, 1) if issue are alive at creation of a will but omitted they have no right to inherit, 2) if decedent fails to provide in will for child born after the wills execution, the child CAN receive share of descendants estate, and 3) CA allows a \"discretionary\" allowance to adult child who are dependent on decedent.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px;\"><br>Here, Dora hasn't spoken to Wilma in 20 years, Dora can't prove Undue Influence to tkae by intestacy and no facts show that Dora was dependent on Wilma when she was alive. I mean, 20 years and no call? So in conclusion, Dora does not have a valid challenge to the will.</p>",

There are two main facts in the first sentence about Pam that give way to some good discussion. Pam's domicile is a key issue and she 1) took an indefinite leave of absence from her job and 2) sublet her apartment to go care for her mother.&nbsp;<br><br>Domicile is defined as the 1) physically present in the state with 2) the intent to permanently remain. This definition also gets used in Community Property essays so it should be a key one to remember. You could argue that if Pam had the intent to permanently remain she would have just quit her job rather than taken a leave of absence. The examiners try to muddy the issue by adding the word \"indefinite\" but that description still doesn't get you to \"permanently remain.\"&nbsp;<br><br>The second fact, is that she sublet her apartment. If you've practiced any real property exams you'll know that someone sublets their apartment when they transfer all or a portion of the premises for less than the entire term of the lease. Compare to an assignment when they transfer all of what they have. This subtle difference could be discussed as showing an intent to return by the nature of her leaving at least some of her living arrangements in tact in whatever state she left.
